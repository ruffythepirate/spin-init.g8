# Spin

Welcome to your Spin project! Now that you have initialized a spin repository, you can feel free to use the Spin-cli for different choirs, for example:

1. `spin build` will build the content in the `src` folder and put the output in `target`.
2. `spin preview` will spawn up a localhost server presenting the content in the `target` folder. If the project is not yet built it will first be built.
3. `spin publish` will publish the static web page content in the target folder to your configured destination.

# Folders

## .spin

Contains the configuration that is used by the *spin-cli*

## src

Contains the source content that will be compiled according to your configured rules.

## target

the target folder where compiled content ends up.
